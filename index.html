            <ul><li><p>Born: August 5, 1981, Denver, Colorado, U.S.A.</p> </li>
              <li> Died: April 20, 1999, Columbine High School, Colorado, U.S.A. Age 17
                <br></br>
                Briefing: Rachel J. Scott was student who was martyred for her faith in Jesus Christ by 2 high school boys who were her classmates.
                <br></br>
The Killers: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. They were both the same age as Rachel, and shared classes with her. 
          <br></br> 
        <i> "Harris and Klebold met while they were in the 7th grade. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they were not near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. From their journals, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack a year prior. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. Harris and Klebold left behind several journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve."
          <br></br>Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold</i>
        <br></br>
Harris and Klebold, were both angry boys. They had already been caught thieving, ending with them being charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft.
 <br></br>
How was Rachel then involved? Rachel was a person who wanted to reach out to many people. Her heart was always yearning to help others, and yearning to work for the LORD. She went to weekly meetings at a bible study and soon became a young youth leader for a small group. She was alo interested in acting. For a period of time, the acting took her away from her youth group. Shemade many friends, and went out to many parties. Rachel went through a period of rebellion...and nly because she was trying t reach out to them. 
  <br></br><b> Life lesson: Often when we Christians try to help others who are very different from us, as Christians, its common that they affect us more than we affect them. Rachel truied to help them, but because she missed a lot of outh meetings, she wasnt getting the right amount of Christian support. Make sure wehn we hang around Non-believers, we must have some more time with Christians to keep us on the right track.</b>
  <br></br>
Anyways, back on track, Rachel reached out to everyone, and lived to be different from those aorund her. One time Harris and Klebold presented their class assignmen about "How would I change the world?" In this they made a video about them shooting anyone and everyone.
